# Intruduction
Xbox-Flood is for flooding messages (invitations will be done soon) on xbox, to use it you need to go to [xbl.io](https://xbl.io), then login and create your key.
This project was created on the intuition that I troll my friends, but I don't recommend it to flood other accounts of unknown people, have fun
